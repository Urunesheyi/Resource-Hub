    <p>As as former newbie coder myself, I understand thst it can seem intimidating at first. <br> But don't worry! As long as you keep at it, you get the hang of it eventually. <br> Plus, there are lots of resources available to help you out. Check out a few of them below:</p>

    <section>
        <!-- Practicing Coding-->
        <h2>Links for practicing coding</h2>
        <p>The following are links to websites I commonly use when practicing coding languages:</p>
        <h3 class="practice"><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a></h3>
        <img src="./codecademy.png" alt="a codecademy page"/>
        <p>Codecademy was the first website I used when starting out coding, and it's one I still use to this day.<br>  With very interactive lessons and step by step instructions on how to build your code, <br> Codecademy will turn you into an experienced coder in no time!</p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a></h3>
        <p>Free Code Camp is another coding website I commonly use. The lessons are longer and <br> more individualized compared to Codecademy, but similarly easy to follow along.</p>

        <h3><a href="'https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a></h3>
        <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is responsible for developing guidelines for writing code, and <br> W3 Schools is their website for studying different type of code. No matter what type of code my might be learning, <br> their website offers all types of helpful tips and tricks for writing the best code you can.</p>
